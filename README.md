## Project Overview üöÄ

Our solution for disaster management is to develop an application that will provide detailed information about the disasters and their types. 

The app will assist the users by showing the preventive measures that are needed to be taken before the disaster, during the disaster and after the disaster.

The app will notify the users about the upcoming disasters that are going to occur in their respective areas and will show the steps to get rescue from that disaster. 

## Tech Stack üíª

The technologies and tools we have used to build our disaster management solution are:

* **HTML** 
* **CSS** 
* **JS** 
* **nodeJS**
* **Flutter**
* **Firebase**
* **Dart**
* **GCP**
* **Google Maps API**

## Project Features and Functionality ‚ú®

1. **Education**: The app will be used for educating the users about the disasters, its types, causes and preventions.

2. **Disaster Prone Areas**: The app is very usefull in the areas which are highly prone to disasters.

3. **Accessibility**: The app will also be accessible without internet also, so that if the user is stuck in the area where no network is there can also access the app and get resuced.

4. **Weather Forecast**: The app will also provide weather forecast, so that the user can see the details of weather of any area.

5. **Disaster Alerts**: The app will notify the user and give alert about the occurence of the disaster in the residential area of the user.

6. **Real Time Tracking**: The app will help the user to know about the details of disaster occuring in their state or in other states.

7. **Emergency Tools**: Siren and flash light of the user's phone will get start as soon as the user get stucks in any disaster and clicks on SOS button.

8. **Notification and Live Location**: The app will notify the user about the disaster that is going to occur in their state or city. Also live location of the user will be shared with his/her relatives.

9. **Cross Device Support**: The app works perfectly in all the devices that are android and IOS.

10. **Special Features for Disabled People**: The app will have special features for disabled people like voice commands or speech recognition,text-to-speech,braille compatibility etc, so that they can also get help when they required.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

As the user will open the application, login page will get appear, and as soon as he will logged in or sign up in the app list of options will be shown.

The first option is about a Tutorial which will teach the user about how to use and manage our application.

The second option is about Details which will provide detailed information about all the natural and man-made disasters, their effects, causes and all the precautions that are to be taken before, during and after the disaster.

The third option is about Daily Weather Forecasting which will help the user to know about the live weather conditions of any state or country.

The fourth option is about Animated videos that will help the user to get more detailed information about the disasters. These videos will be made by us only.

The fifth option is about Partnerships which will tell the user about all the NGOs and helping centers that are connected with us for rescuing the people stuck in any kind of disaster.

The sixth option is about Game Based Learning which will help the user to know all the details of the disasters in the form of playing games. All the games will be based on a particular disaster which will help the user to know about how to get rescue from that disaster.

## Challenges and Solutions üß†

## Future Enhancements üöß

1. **Cross device support**: We will develop an application that will be accessible in all the devices like android devices, IOS devices and featured devices.

2. **Integration With Government Initiatives**: Our application will also provide the details about the initiatives taken by the government to get rid from these disasters.

3. **Improving User Experience**: Our application will help the user to improve his expercience by consistently gathering the knowledge about the disasters, their causes and precautions.

4. **Multi Lingual Support**: Our application will allow the user to gather the information about the disasters in multiple languages.

5. **Accessibility Features**: Our application will also be accessed offline, as there are chances that the area where the user is stuck does not have network.

6. **Reducing API Dependencies**: We will try to make our own APIs which will make the application more unique.

7. **Enhancing User and Volunteer Relation**: Our application will help the user to contact the volunteer easily so that he must get rescued on time.

8. **User Feedback**: The user can easily give the feedback about the application, information shared with him, methods used to rescue him, about the volunteer and all other features of application.
